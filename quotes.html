<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>To each is given a bag of tools,
an hourglass and a book of rules.
And each must build, ere time has flown,
a stumbling block or stepping-stone.
</code></pre></div></div>

<ul>
  <li>Do the most important thing first in the morning.</li>
  <li>Practice Daily Routine - Schedule gives you freedom and maintains structure.</li>
  <li>Read daily.</li>
  <li>Be not angry that you cannot make others as you wish them to be, instead focus to make yourself as you wish to be.</li>
  <li>The best Math you can learn is how to calculate the future cost of current decision.</li>
  <li>Make the best of Today!</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Kaizen - continuously improve</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>1% Rule</strong> : Improve 1% daily, within a year you are 37 times better now.</li>
  <li><strong>Pereto Principle</strong> : 80% results come from 20% work.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Motivation</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Whatever we do willingly is easy! More you work, the luckier you get.</li>
  <li>Only those who risk going too far can possibly find out how far they can go.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="some-more">Some more</h1>

<ul>
  <li>Think strongly, attempt fearlessly and accomplish masterfully.</li>
  <li>Schedule your priorities, be an effective minimalist.</li>
  <li>Be calm in thoughts and uncompromising in actions, not vice versa.</li>
  <li>Reading is to the mind, what exercise is to body.</li>
  <li>You may be disppointed if you fail, but you are doomed if you don’t try.</li>
  <li>If I had 6 hours to chop down a tree, I’d spend first 4 hours sharpening the axe.</li>
  <li>What’s the point of being alive if you don’t atleast try to do something remarkable.</li>
  <li>Having the discipline to do what you know you should do, even when you don’t feel like doing it.</li>
  <li>The only thing that overcomes hard luck is hard work.</li>
  <li>Follow the 5 hour golden rule.</li>
  <li>Life is not about finding yourself, but about creating yourself.</li>
  <li>Your problem is not the problem, your reaction is the problem.</li>
  <li>You can do anything, but not everything.</li>
  <li>Success is sum of small efforts, repeated day-in and day-out.</li>
  <li>Only put off until tomorrow what you are willing to die having left undone.</li>
  <li>The successful warrior is the average man with laser like focus.</li>
  <li>Don’t let he fear of losing be greater than the excitement of winning.</li>
  <li>Our greatest fear should not be of failure but of succeeding at the things in life that don’t really matter.</li>
  <li>Motivation is what gets you started, Habit is what keeps you going.</li>
  <li>Don’t raise your voice, improve your argument.</li>
  <li>Don’t be afraid to give up the good to go for the great.</li>
  <li>No masterpiece was ever created by a lazy artist.</li>
  <li>If you can’t explain it simply, you don’t understand it well enough.</li>
  <li>Always bear in mind that your own resolution to succeed is more important than any other.</li>
  <li>As I would not be a slave, so I would not be a master. This expresses my idea of democracy.</li>
  <li>Books serve to show a man that those original thoughts aren’t very new at all.</li>
  <li>Don’t worry when you are not recognized, but strive to be worthy of recognition.</li>
  <li>Everybody likes a compliment.</li>
  <li>If you want to achieve greatness, stop asking for permission.</li>
  <li>Things work out best for those who make the best of how things work.</li>
  <li>Opportunities don’t happen, you create them.</li>
  <li>Good things happen to people who wait, but better things come to those who go out and get them.</li>
  <li>Just when the caterpiller thought the world was ending, it turns into a butterfly.</li>
  <li>The horse in the field knows nothing of breakfast, lunch and dinner. It eats when hungry. The point of Zen is to follow the same kind of naturalness.</li>
  <li>If you don’t purposefully carve out time every day to progress and improve, without quesion your time will get lost in the vaccum of our increasingly crowded lives. Before you know it, you will be old and withered, wondering where all the time went.</li>
  <li>There are fewer things more liberating than the feeling of finally facing something that you had put off or had been afraid of for so long.</li>
</ul>
