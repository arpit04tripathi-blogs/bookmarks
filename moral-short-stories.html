<h1 id="duck-on-a-pond">Duck on a Pond!</h1>
<p>Have you ever seen a duck swimming in a pond? It appears so calm - almost tranquil! But do you know that underneath the surface, it is paddling away crazily at a speed of more than 50 miles per hour! That’s how it swims.</p>

<p>You gotta be just like a duck on a pond!
On the surface, you must be calm… very very calm… But underneath, you have to paddle away like crazy…
That’s the mantra of being successful in life - Duck on a Pond!</p>

<h1 id="a-person-who-thinks-too-much-of-the-alternatives">A person who thinks too much of the alternatives</h1>

<p>A professor asked us in a class one day “Can anyone of you tell me why only a few of a class of say 50 students will be able to repeat everything I said and the rest won’t?</p>

<p>To which one replied “it’s probably because of the concentration level sir, some have better than others. “</p>

<p>To which he smirked and said “it’s faith and devotion that has got everything to do with it”</p>

<p>Seeing the student flabbergasted he went on explaining “Amongst all of you,  there are some,  who know that the same crap will be available in some textbook and they’ll get it from there</p>

<p>an another group might be under the impression that this guy doesn’t know anything,</p>

<p>but the people I am talking about, are the ones who trust me fully and have devoted themselves to me. They hear me out before being judgemental, I am not saying I am always right but I am saying that they’re hearing to what I say and that is the key. A person who thinks too much of the alternatives rather than focusing on the current path seldom finds that perfect alternative”.</p>

<h1 id="the-abundance-principle">The Abundance Principle</h1>

<p>Once a man got lost in a desert. The water in his flask had run out two days ago, and he was on his last legs. He knew that if he didn’t get some water soon, he would surely die. The man saw a small hut ahead of him. He thought it would be a mirage or maybe a hallucination, but having no other option, he moved toward it. As he got closer, he realized it was quite real. So he dragged his tired body to the door with the last of his strength.</p>

<p>The hut was not occupied and seemed like it had been abandoned for quite some time. The man entered into it, hoping against hope that he might find water inside.</p>

<p>His heart skipped a beat when he saw what was in the hut - a water hand pump…… It had a pipe going down through the floor, perhaps tapping a source of water deep under-ground.</p>

<p>He began working the hand pump, but no water came out. He kept at it and still nothing happened. Finally he gave up from exhaustion and frustration. He threw up his hands in despair. It looked as if he was going to die after all.</p>

<p>Then the man noticed a bottle in one corner of the hut. It was filled with water and corked up to prevent evaporation.</p>

<p>He uncorked the bottle and was about to gulp down the sweet life-giving water, when he noticed a piece of paper attached to it. Handwriting on the paper read : “Use this water to start the pump. Don’t forget to fill the bottle when you’re done.”</p>

<p>He had a dilemma. He could follow the instruction and pour the water into the pump, or he could ignore it and just drink the water.</p>

<p>What to do? If he let the water go into the pump, what assurance did he have that it would work? What if the pump malfunctioned? What if the pipe had a leak? What if the underground reservoir had long dried up?</p>

<p>But then… maybe the instruction was correct. Should he risk it? If it turned out to be false, he would be throwing away the last water he would ever see.</p>

<p>Hands trembling, he poured the water into the pump. Then he closed his eyes, said a prayer, and started working the pump.</p>

<p>He heard a gurgling sound, and then water came gushing out, more than he could possibly use. He luxuriated in the cool and refreshing stream. He was going to live!</p>

<p>After drinking his fill and feeling much better, he looked around the hut. He found a pencil and a map of the region. The map showed that he was still far away from civilization, but at least now he knew where he was and which direction to go.</p>

<p>He filled his flask for the journey ahead. He also filled the bottle and put the cork back in. Before leaving the hut, he added his own writing below the instruction: “Believe me, it works!”</p>

<p>This story is all about life. It teaches us that We must GIVE before We can RECEIVE Abundantly.</p>

<p>More importantly, it also teaches that FAITH plays an important role in GIVING.</p>

<p>The man did not know if his action would be rewarded, but he proceeded regardless.</p>

<p>Without knowing what to expect, he made a Leap of Faith.</p>

<p>Water in this story represents the Good things in Life</p>

<p>Give life some Water to Work with, and it will RETURN far more than you put in……..!!</p>
